# Supersonics Project 1

## Project 1 Overview

This application is being built with the intention of finding a restaurant or bar in nearby proximity of the user. We took into consideration that people nowadays are indecisive and have short attention spans so this application is meant to utilize a simple interface to produce immediate results.
The opening screen grabs the userâ€™s current location and asks whether they would like to go something to eat or grab a drink. Once a choice is created, the app finds a bar or restaurant within a preset distance and displays the results on a screen with a small bit of information. If the user is happy with the displayed result, they can get get directions to the establishment. If not, they can swipe it away and a new result is displayed. If the user likes the result but would like to save it for later, they can swipe it into a list which can be accessed later.
